CLickz0r: A Pixel Based Rotation Bot

Clickz0r is a simple pixel based rotation bot for MMORPGs.

Features:
-Advanced cloaking techniques like random window sizes, exe file pumping, decompilation protection and more.
-Compatible with most MMORPGs
-Easy to use
-One time payment with lifetime license


Usage:
-Start Clickz0 (WindowsFormsApp1.exe). The exe file will be renamed.
-Enter a name for the button and select the key to be pressed (0-9)
-Click the "Set" button
-Focus the game window
-Move your mouse to the pixel you want to be monitored. 
 This will most likely be one of the first pixels left of the middle of the button and a few pixels below the top of the button.
 Thus it will detect the cooldown.
-Hit the "F11" key and wait a few seconds
-Focus the Clickz0r app window
-Click "Add"

Now you can get back into the game and toggle the bot using the "F" key.

Disclaimer: Even though Clickz0r has got a verry low detection rate, some anticheat programs might detect it.
Only use it on accounts that you can afford to loose!
